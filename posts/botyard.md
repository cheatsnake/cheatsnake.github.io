I recently developed a small platform that allows you to program chatbots and communicate with them. This is quite an interesting experience, as I took the project architecture, external API development, and documentation writing quite seriously.

[Source code](https://github.com/cheatsnake/botyard) is available on GitHub. I have also deployed [small demo](https://botyard.yurace.pro).

In general, I have a hard time creating UI-interfaces, so I'm always thinking about some universal platform for interacting with server applications. And due to the long hype around ChatGPT, the idea of interacting with the application by means of text requests now seems so complicated, even for an average Internet user. Take for example the messenger Telegram, where the development of chatbots that can be interacted with through certain sets of commands has been flourishing for many years. So I came to the conclusion that it is worth trying to make some kind of universal platform just for the development of such bots.
